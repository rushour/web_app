The concept is very similar to Ruby on Rails idea of seeding a database. This allows a new developer to pull down the source code for a project (which contains .json files to populate their mongodb with) and run a command and bingo!! database populated and ready to rock.\n\n## Usage\n\n- Run `$ npm install -g node-mongo-seeds`\n- Run `$ seed-setup` from the root of your project to generate a `seed.json` file\n- Replace `\"localhost/LOCAL_DB_NAME\"` with the path to your mongodb in your brand new seed.json file\n- Create a `/seeds` folder in your project root and put `.json` files in there.\n\t\tThe name of the file is going to be the collection name in mongo and the contents\n\t\tof the file will be populated into that mongo collection.\n- Run `$ seed` to seed your mongodb with all your data from your `/seeds` folder.\n\n**Note**: Every time you run `$ seed` it will blow away all the data in your collections and re-populate them with whatever is in your `/seeds` directory.\n\n### Separate databases per NODE_ENV\n\nYou can have separate databases for each NODE_ENV that you are using. Just a put a line in seed.json for each NODE_ENV that you are going to use. It defaults to \"undefined\", \"dev\", and \"prod\" but can be changed to whatever.\n\n##Contributing\n\n1. Clone project and run `npm install -g ./` from project root\n2. Add feature(s) \n3. Add tests for it\n4. Submit pull request\n\nEnjoy!\n",
